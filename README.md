# Hangman

## About hangman
The point of this Hangman application is that the user inputs one letter at a time and tries to guess a secret word. The user should only have a limited number of guesses and if these runs out before the user has guessed the correct word, the game is lost.

## To do
- Create a list of words
- Randomly pick a secret word from the list and display a representation of that word in the browser (i.e. show how many letters are in it)
- Check if the user inputted letter is in the current secret word
- Create a logic for win/loose
- If user inputted letter is correct, show it in the displayed representation of the secret word
